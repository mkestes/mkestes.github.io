        <p>Something excited happened. I made a blog on Khan Aacademy as an assignment for my Computer Programming: Intro to HTML/CSS course. Maybe it will become a way to document my journey into the world of programming. Maybe I'll forget about it like the other twelve journals I've started and forgotten about.
        </p>
        <p>Writing is a task that I only like to do when I feel like it, probably similarily to the majority of folks. Obviously, I'm feeling quite <em>inspired</em> today. Lucky you.</p><br>
        <p>Spring Break 2014 was an exciting time for me. My parents had graciously gifted me a new-to-me red 2000 Subaru Forester in August, I was a freshman in college, and I was experiencing more freedom than ever before.</p>
        <p>Through high school and my first year of college, I did not work during the school year. I would work long days and even longer weeks at Water World, a 60-acre waterpark I sold my soul to for a solid six summers. In high school, I was swimming competitively and didn't have time to hold down a job, so I needed to make as much money as possible in the summer to support my shenanigans during the winter. I started at University of Colorado Colorado Springs in the fall of 2014 after a long summer of hard work and thought "school is my job now, I don't need a real job yet." When I look back at that choice now, all I can think is "HA HA." That was a very naiive choice.</p>
        <p>After a few months of living the classic college lifestyle, my bank account was quite the sight for sore eyes. But I still wanted to have a spring break. Skiing has always been a passion of mine, so I decided to go on a ski trip. All of my friends were planning expensive vacations or going home and a budget ski trip wasn't very appealing in comparison. The trip very quickly became a solo adventure.</p>
        <p>The friday before break started I packed my trusty Subaru (nicknamed Speedy) and took off. I had the perfect set up. The back seats of the Speedy fold down to create a perfectly flat space for a bed and storage. My skis stayed in the rooftop Thule box to prevent the interior from getting covered in snow, and my boots stayed snuggled up to the heater in the front passenger floor.</p>
        <p>That week, I traveled the I-70 corridor from Denver, CO to Grand Junction, CO skiing at four different ski resorts and never sleeping in the same place two nights in a row. It will always be a highlight of my life because of the events it set in to motion. I was able to really begin the process of figuring out who I was, what I liked to do, where I wanted to go, and who I wanted to be.</p>
        <p>My dad is the one who came up with the name "Molly's Big Adventure." That was how he talked about my trip, and since then, how he's catalogued my life. The big joke between us is always "what's the next chapter in Molly's Big Adventure?" Most recently, it was "Molly Moves to Seattle!" and before that, "Molly gets Married!"</p>
        <p><strong>Welcome to Molly's Big Adventure: Molly takes on Computer Programming.</strong></p><br>

        <p>
            Computer programming has always been interesting to me. My major for the first year of college was officially undecided, but I was pursuing the course schedule for a computer science degree. Sophomore year, I changed my major to Business because I didn't really know what I wanted to do and I thought it was a nice general degree that would compliment the few classes of computer science I had taken, or the twelve other interests I had at the time.</p>
            <p>Under formal instruction, I have completed I completed Principles of Computer Science (based in Java) and Data Structures and Algorithms (based in C++ with some Visual Basic). For financial and personal reasons, I chose not to continue my education in a formal setting after the Spring 2016 semester. I have continued to do online coding "camps" through freecodecamp.com (HTML and CSS), codeacademy.com (code foundations), and Kahn Academy (various tutorials and videos). At UCCS in the introduction to programming course, we created projects from the textbook Introduction to Programming through Java. During the data structures and algorithms course, we traced the lineage of the United States giraffe herd, analyzed the diversity of the herd, created a family tree using Visual Basic in PowerPoint, and developed a way to predict which male and female giraffes should mate to continue the diversity of the herd equal to what would occur in the wild.</p>
            <p>I am now working towards becoming a student at Code Fellows, a coding academy based in Seattle, WA. To pass their entrance exam, I must first complete the Khan Academy Intro to HTML/CSS and JavaScript tutorials. Hence the creation of this blog. The course I am applying for is Code 201: Foundations of Software Development. It starts April 29th and goes through May 24th. After that, I aspire to also take Code 301: Intermediate Software Development (June 3rd - June 28th) and Code 401. I have not yet decided which Code 401 course I would like to take because each variation emphasizes a different language and I'm not ready to choose a language.</p>
            <p>I understand the importance of a college degree, and therefore, I am planning to obtain my bachelors degree in Business Administration from the University of Washington once I qualify for in-state tuition rates in January 2020. After the undergraduate program and UW, I can apply to a certifaction course for Program Management.</p>
            <p>I still do not have a specific job in mind, but I have goals. I have started down a path that I will see success from, as long as I keep pushing and stay focused. Without my husband, this journey would not be possible. He is my biggest supporter, my cheerleader, my coach, and my partner in this challenge. I thank God for that man and the life we are creating together.</p><br>
